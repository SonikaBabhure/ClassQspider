                </center>
                <p> Varanasi also Banaras
                    is a city on the Ganges river in the Bhojpur-Purvanchal region
                    of India, that has a central place in the traditions of pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu
                    world. Located in the middle-Ganges valley in the southeastern part of the state of Uttar
                    Pradesh, Varanasi lies on the left bank of the river. It is 692 kilometres (430 mi) to the southeast
                    of India's capital New Delhi and 320 kilometres (200 mi) to the east of the state capital, Lucknow.
                    It
                    lies
                    121 kilometres (75 mi) downstream of Allahabad (officially Prayagraj), where the confluence with the
                    Yamuna river is another major Hindu pilgrimage site. </p>
                <p> Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities. Kashi, its ancient name, was
                    associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby
                    Sarnath has been interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth
                    century BCE. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an
                    official sect of Varanasi. Since ancient times, the city has been an important centre of Hindu
                    devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry contributing to its cultural importance. Tulsidas
                    wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit
                    Ramayana, in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi,
                    including Kabir and Ravidas. In the 16th century, Rajput nobles in the service of the courts and
                    armies of the Mughal emperor Akbar, sponsored the building or further enhancement of the major Shiva
                    temple in the city; they also built other temples, all displaying an empire-wide architectural
                    style. Under the Treaty of Faizabad, the East India Company acquired Benares in
                    1775, the city later successively becoming a part of the Benares State in the Ceded and
                    Conquered Provinces, the North-Western Provinces, and the United Provinces, and after India's
                    independence of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
                <p>The city is known worldwide for its many ghats, steps leading down the steep river bank to the water,
                    where pilgrims perform rituals. Of particular note are the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat,
                    the Manikarnika Ghat, and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their
                    dead. The Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here. Among the notable temples in Varanasi
                    are Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, and the Durga Temple. The
                    city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its religious tourism. Silk
                    weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do
                    the Banaras Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals.</p>
                <p>The city has long been an educational and musical centre: many prominent Indian philosophers, poets,
                    writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the Benares
                    gharana form of Hindustani classical music was developed. In the 20th-century the Hindi-Urdu writer
                    Premchand and the shehnai player Bismillah Khan were associated with the city. India's oldest
                    Sanskrit college, the Benares Sanskrit College, was founded during East India Company rule in 1791.
                    Later education in Benares was greatly influenced by the rise of Indian nationalism in the late
                    19th-century. Annie Besant founded the Central Hindu College in 1898. In 1916, she and Madan Mohan
                    Malviya founded the Banaras Hindu University, India's first modern residential university. Kashi
                    Vidyapith was established in 1921, a response to Mahatma Gandhi's Non-cooperation movement.</p>

                    <h1>Mythology</h1>
                </center>
                <p>According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva, one of three principal deities along
                    with Brahma and Vishnu. During a conflict between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was
                    torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and
                    let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was
                    also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonoured Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times.
                    When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's
                    hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.</p>
                <p>The Pandavas, the protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, are said to have visited the city in
                    search of Shiva to atone for their sins of fratricide and brahmahatya that they had committed during
                    the Kurukshetra War. It is regarded as one of seven holy cities (Sapta Puri) which can provide
                    Moksha; Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Kashi, Kanchi, Avanti, and Dvārakā are the seven cities known as
                    the givers of liberation.The princesses Ambika and Ambalika of Kashi were wed to the
                    Hastinapura ruler Vichitravirya, and they later gave birth to Pandu and Dhritarashtra. Bhima, a son
                    of Pandu, married a Kashi princess Valandhara and their union resulted in the birth of Sarvaga, who
                    later ruled Kashi. Dhritarasthra's eldest son Duryodhana also married a Kashi princess Bhanumati,
                    who later bore him a son Lakshmana Kumara and a daughter Lakshmanā.</p>

                </center>
                <p> The Himalayas, or Himalaya
                    is a mountain range in Asia, separating the plains
                    of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has some of the Earth's highest
                    peaks, including the very highest, Mount Everest. Over 100 peaks exceeding 7,200 m (23,600 ft) in
                    elevation lie in the Himalayas.</p>
                <p> The Himalayas abut or cross five countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, and Pakistan. The
                    sovereignty of the range in the Kashmir region is disputed among India, Pakistan, and China.The
                    Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by
                    the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the world's major rivers,
                    the Indus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo–Brahmaputra, rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their
                    combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people; 53 million people live in the
                    Himalayas.The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. Many
                    Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. The summits of several—Kangchenjunga (from the
                    Indian side), Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare, Nanda Devi, and Kailas in the Tibetan
                    Transhimalaya—are off-limits to climbers</p>
                <p>Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate, the Himalayan
                    mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an arc 2,400 km (1,500 mi) long.Its
                    western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its
                    eastern anchor, Namcha Barwa, lies immediately west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River.
                    The range varies in width from 350 km (220 mi) in the west to 150 km (93 mi) in the east.</p>
                <p>The Himalayas consist of parallel mountain ranges: the Sivalik Hills on the south; the Lower
                    Himalayan Range; the Great Himalayas, which is the highest and central range; and the Tibetan
                    Himalayas on the north.The Karakoram are generally considered separate from the Himalayas.

                    In the middle of the great curve of the Himalayan mountains lie the 8,000 m (26,000 ft) peaks of
                    Dhaulagiri and Annapurna in Nepal, separated by the Kali Gandaki Gorge. The gorge splits the
                    Himalayas into Western and Eastern sections, both ecologically and orographically – the pass at the
                    head of the Kali Gandaki, the Kora La, is the lowest point on the ridgeline between Everest and K2
                    (the highest peak of the Karakoram range). To the east of Annapurna are the 8,000 m (5.0 mi) peaks
                    of Manaslu and across the border in Tibet, Shishapangma. To the south of these lies Kathmandu, the
                    capital of Nepal and the largest city in the Himalayas. </p>

                    <h1>Geology</h1>
                </center>
                <p>The Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of
                    uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. According to the modern theory of plate tectonics, its
                    formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary (Main
                    Himalayan Thrust) between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Arakan Yoma
                    highlands in Myanmar and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal were also formed as a
                    result of this collision.</p>
                <p>During the Upper Cretaceous, about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate
                    (which has subsequently broken into the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate[19]) was moving at
                    about 15 cm (5.9 in) per year. About 50 million years ago this fast-moving Indo-Australian Plate had
                    completely closed the Tethys Ocean, the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks
                    settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed
                    of low density continental crust, they were thrust faulted and folded into mountain ranges rather
                    than subducting into the mantle along an oceanic trench.[18] An often-cited fact used to illustrate
                    this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of unmetamorphosed marine Ordovician
                    limestone with fossil trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods from this ancient ocean.</p>

                </center>
                <p> The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory of India consisting of 572 islands, of which 37
                    are inhabited, at the junction of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.The territory is about
                    150 km (93 mi) north of Aceh in Indonesia and separated from Thailand and Myanmar by the Andaman
                    Sea. It comprises two island groups, the Andaman Islands (partly) and the Nicobar Islands, separated
                    by the 150 km (100 mile) wide Ten Degree Channel (on the 10°N parallel), with the Andaman islands to
                    the north of this latitude, and the Nicobar islands to the south (or by 179 km; 111 miles). The
                    Andaman Sea lies to the east and the Bay of Bengal to the west. The island chains are thought to be
                    a submerged extension of the Arakan Mountains.</p>
                <p> The territory's capital is the city of Port Blair. The total land area of the islands is
                    approximately 8,249 km2 (3,185 sq mi). The territory is divided into three districts: the Nicobar
                    District with Car Nicobar as its capital, the South Andaman district with Port Blair as its capital,
                    and the North and Middle Andaman district with Mayabunder as its capital.
                    The islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only tri-service geographical command of the
                    Indian Armed Forces.</p>
                <p>The Andaman Islands are also home to the Sentinelese people, an uncontacted tribe. The Sentinelese
                    are considered to be the only people currently known to not have reached further than a Paleolithic
                    level of technology; however, this is disputed, as evidence of metalwork was found on their
                    island.</p>
                <p>The earliest archaeological evidence documents some 2,200 years. However, genetic and cultural
                    studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations
                    during the Middle Paleolithic, which ended 30,000 years ago.Since that time, the Andamanese have
                    diversified into linguistically and culturally distinct territorial groups. </p>

                <p>There are 572 islands in the territory having an area of 8,249 km2 (3,185 sq mi). Of these 38 are
                    permanently inhabited. The islands extend from 6° to 14° North latitudes and from 92° to 94° East
                    longitudes. The Andamans are separated from the Nicobar group by a channel (the Ten Degree Channel)
                    some 150 km (93 mi) wide. The highest point is located in North Andaman Island (Saddle Peak at 732 m
                    (2,402 ft)). The Andaman group has 325 islands which cover an area of 6,170 km2 (2,382 sq mi) while
                    the Nicobar group has only 247 islands with an area of 1,765 km2 (681 sq mi).</p>
                <p>The capital of the union territory, Port Blair, is located 1,255 km (780 mi) from Kolkata, 1,200 km
                    (750 mi) from Visakhapatnam and 1,190 km (740 mi) from Chennai. They are grouped with South
                    India.The northernmost point of the Andaman and Nicobars group is 901 km (560 mi) away from the
                    mouth of the Hooghly River and 280 km (170 mi) from Myanmar Mainland. Indira Point at 6°45’10″N and
                    93°49’36″E at the southern tip of the southernmost island, Great Nicobar, is the southernmost point
                    of India and lies only 200 km (120 mi) from Sumatra island in Indonesia.</p>

                </center>
                <p> Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of
                    the field') is a Hindu temple roughly 1200 years old[1] dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located on
                    the Garhwal Himalayan range[citation needed] near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand,
                    India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the
                    months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the
                    winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next
                    six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the
                    historical name of the region.[2]

                    The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi)
                    uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan service is available to reach the temple.
                    According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by the Pandavas, and is one of the twelve
                    Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[3] The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased
                    Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.[4][3] The temple is one of the four major sites in India's
                    Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage
                    sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[5] It is one of the 275 paadal petra
                    sthalams expounded in the Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th
                    centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars. This temple is sung of by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar,
                    Sundarar and Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts</p>
                <p> Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple
                    complex, surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure
                    did not suffer any major damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was
                    caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a
                    barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the
                    market area were heavily damaged</p>
                <p>The temple, at a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of
                    Mandakini river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date.[8] It is not certain who
                    built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name "Kedarnath" means "the lord of the field": it
                    derives from the Sanskrit words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya
                    states that it is so called because "the crop of liberation" grows here.</p>
                <p>A folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.
                    The Pandavas defeated and slew their cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished
                    to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins
                    — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin
                    and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of
                    Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
                    But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the
                    Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form
                    of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.</p>

                    <h1>Construction</h1>
                </center>
                <p>Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five
                    Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull
                    grazing near Guptakashi ("hidden Kashi" — the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima
                    immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind
                    legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the
                    hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the
                    nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The
                    Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places
                    for venerating and worshipping Shiva</p>
                <p>A variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from
                    disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations
                    in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas.[10] After building the Panch Kedar Temples,
                    the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through
                    the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or
                    salvation.[citation needed].[12] The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian
                    Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking
                    similar.</p>

                <p> Rajasthan is a state in northern
                    India.It covers 342,239 square kilometres (132,139 sq mi) or 10.4 per cent of India's
                    total geographical area. It is the largest Indian state by area and the seventh largest by
                    population. It is on India's northwestern side, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable
                    Thar Desert (also known as the Great Indian Desert) and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces
                    of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus River valley. It is
                    bordered by five other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the
                    northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. Its geographical location
                    is 23.3 to 30.12 North latitude and 69.30 to 78.17 East longitude, with the Tropic of Cancer passing
                    through its southernmost tip.</p>
                <p> Its major features include the ruins of the Indus Valley civilisation at Kalibangan and Balathal,
                    the Dilwara Temples, a Jain pilgrimage site at Rajasthan's only hill station, Mount Abu, in the
                    ancient Aravalli mountain range and eastern Rajasthan, the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, a
                    World Heritage Site[15] known for its bird life. Rajasthan is also home to three national tiger
                    reserves, the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur, Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar and the
                    Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve in Kota.</p>
                <p>The state was formed on 30 March 1949 when Rajputana – the name adopted by the British Raj for its
                    dependencies in the region – was merged into the Dominion of India. Its capital and largest city
                    is Jaipur. Other important cities are Jodhpur, Kota, Bikaner, Ajmer, Bharatpur and Udaipur. The
                    economy of Rajasthan is the seventh-largest state economy in India with ₹10.20 lakh crore (US$130
                    billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of ₹118,000 (US$1,500).Rajasthan ranks
                    29th among Indian states in human development index.</p>
                <p>Rajasthan literally means "The Land of Kings" and is a portmanteau of Sanskrit "Rājā" (King) and
                    Sanskrit "Sthāna"(Land) or Persian "St(h)ān" with the same meaning.The oldest reference to
                    Rajasthan is found in a stone inscription dated back to 625 CE. The first printed mention of the
                    name Rajasthan appears in the 1829 publication Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan or the Central
                    and Western Rajpoot States of India, while the earliest known record of Rajputana as a name for the
                    region is in George Thomas's 1800 memoir Military Memories. John Keay, in his book India: A
                    History, stated that Rajputana was coined by the British in 1829, John Briggs, translating
                    Ferishta's history of early Islamic India, used the phrase "Rajpoot (Rajput) princes" rather than
                    "Indian princes"</p>

                <p>Parts of what is now Rajasthan were partly part of the Vedic Civilisation and the Indus Valley
                    civilization. Kalibangan, in Hanumangarh district, was a major provincial capital of the Indus
                    Valley Civilization. Another archaeological excavation at the Balathal site in Udaipur district
                    shows a settlement contemporary with the Harrapan civilisation dating back to 3000–1500 BCE.

                    Stone Age tools dating from 5,000 to 200,000 years were found in Bundi and Bhilwara districts of the

                    <h1>Ladakh</h1>
                </center>
                <p> Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory which constitutes a
                    part of the larger Kashmir region and has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan, and
                    China since 1947.Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian
                    state of Himachal Pradesh to the south, both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and
                    Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, and the southwest corner of
                    Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the
                    Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south.The eastern end,
                    consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed by the Indian Government as part of
                    Ladakh, and has been under Chinese control since 1962</p>
                <p> In the past, Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important
                    trade routes, but as Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and
                    Ladakh in the 1960s, international trade dwindled. Since 1974, the Government of India has
                    successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. As Ladakh is strategically important, the Indian military
                    maintains a strong presence in the region.</p>
                <p>The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district.The
                    Leh district contains the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains the
                    Suru, Dras and Zanskar river valleys. The main populated regions are the river valleys, but the
                    mountain slopes also support pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious groups in the region are
                    Muslims (mainly Shia) (46%), Buddhists (mainly Tibetan Buddhists) (40%), and Hindus (12%) with the
                    remaining 2% made of other religions. Ladakh is one of the most sparsely populated regions
                    in India. Its culture and history are closely related to those of Tibet</p>
                <p>Ladakh was established as a union territory of India on 31 October, 2019, following the passage of
                    the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. Prior to that, it was part of the Jammu and Kashmir state.
                    Ladakh is both the largest and the second least populous union territory of India</p>

                </center>
                <p>Rock carvings found in many parts of Ladakh indicate that the area has been inhabited from Neolithic
                    times.Ladakh's earliest inhabitants consisted of nomads known as Kampa. Later settlements
                    were established by Mons from Kullu and Brokpas who originated from Gilgit. Around the 1st
                    century, Ladakh was a part of the Kushan Empire. Buddhism spread into western Ladakh from Kashmir in
                    the 2nd century. The 7th-century Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes the region in his
                    accounts.Xuanzang's term of Ladakh is Mo-lo-so, which has been reconstructed by academics as
                    *Malasa, *Marāsa, or *Mrāsa, which is believed to have been the original name of the region</p>
                <p>For much of the first millennium, western Tibet comprised Zhangzhung kingdom(s), which practised the
                    Bon religion. Sandwiched between Kashmir and Zhangzhung, Ladakh is believed to have been
                    alternatively under the control of one or other of these powers. Academics find strong influences of
                    Zhangzhung language and culture in "upper Ladakh" (from the middle section of the Indus valley to
                    the southeast). The penultimate king of Zhangzhung is said to have been from Ladakh.</p>

                    <h1>Badrinath</h1>
                </center>
                <p> Badrinath or Badrinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu. It is situated in the town
                    of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India. The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to
                    Vishnu - holy shrines for Vaishnavas - who is worshipped as Badrinath. It is open for six months
                    every year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather
                    conditions in the Himalayan region. The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district
                    along the banks of Alaknanda River. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India,
                    having recorded 2.8 million (28 lakh) visits in just 2 months in 2022.[1] It is one of the Char Dham
                    pilgrimage sites.
                    The image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple is a 1 ft (0.30 m), the black granite
                    deity of Vishnu in the form of Badrinarayan. The deity is considered by many Hindus to be one of
                    eight svayam vyakta kshetras, or self-manifested deities of Vishnu.</p>
                <p> Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of river Ganges on mother earth, is the most
                    prominent festival celebrated in the Badrinath Temple. Although Badrinath is located in North India,
                    the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a Nambudiri Brahmin chosen from the South Indian state
                    of Kerala. The temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no.
                    16,1939, which later came to be known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. The
                    committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples and has seventeen members
                    on its board.
                    Devotees at the Badrinath Temple in October 2022
                    The temple is mentioned in ancient religious texts like Vishnu Purana and Skanda Purana. It is
                    glorified in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, an early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from
                    the 6th–9th centuries CE.</p>
                <p>The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracts along the banks of the Alaknanda River[3] in Chamoli
                    district in Uttarakhand. The hill tracts are located 3,133 m (10,279 ft) above the mean sea
                    level.[4][5] The Nar Parbat mountain is located opposite to the temple, while the Narayana Parbat is
                    located behind the Neelkanth peak.Adi Shankara established Badrinath as a pilgrimage site in the
                    ninth century. The temple has three structures: the Garbhagriha (sanctum), the Darshan Mandapa
                    (worship hall), and Sabha Mandapa (convention hall).[4][6][7] The conical-shaped roof of the
                    sanctum, the garbhagriha, is approximately 15 m (49 ft) tall with a small cupola on top, covered
                    with a gold gilt roof.[6][8] The facade is built of stone and has arched windows. A broad stairway
                    leads up to the main entrance, a tall, arched gateway. Just inside is a mandap, a large, pillared
                    hall that leads to the sanctum, or main shrine area. The walls and pillars of the hall are covered
                    with intricate carvings.</p>
                <p>The main shrine houses the 1 ft (0.30 m) Shaligram (black stone) deity of Badrinarayana, which is
                    housed in a gold canopy under a Badri Tree. The deity of Badrinarayana shows Him holding a Shankha
                    (conch) and a Chakra (wheel) in two of His arms in a lifted posture and the other two arms resting
                    on His lap in a Yogamudra (Padmasana) posture.[4][7] The sanctum also houses images of the god of
                    wealth—Kubera, sage Narada, Uddhava, Nara and Narayana. There are fifteen more images that are also
                    worshipped around the temple. These include that of Lakshmi (the consort of Vishnu), Garuda (the
                    vahana of Narayan), and Navadurga, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. The temple
                    also has shrines of Lakshmi Narasimhar and for saints Adi Shankara (CE 788-820), Nar and Narayan,
                    Ghantakarna, Vedanta Desika and Ramanujacharya. All the deities of the temple are made of black
                    stone.</p>

                    <h1>Description</h1>
                </center>
                <p>There is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of the presiding deity
                    Badrinath in Vedic scriptures (c. 1750–500 BCE).[6] According to some accounts, the shrine was
                    worshipped in some form in the Vedic period. The architecture of the temple resembling that of a
                    Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads
                    to the argument.[2] Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by
                    Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara resided in the place for six years
                    from CE 814 to 820. He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year in Kedarnath. Hindu
                    followers assert that he discovered the deity of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it
                    in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs.</p>
                <p>A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled
                    all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal, however this might
                    be fictitious and very recent because historically, Parmars did not rule the region contemporary to
                    Shankaracharya. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to
                    meet its expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and
                    accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title "Bolanda Badrinath", meaning speaking
                    Badrinath. They had other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra,
                    Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.</p>

                    gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[3][4] It is the preeminent spiritual site
                    of Sikhism. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur
                    in Kartarpur, and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.Amritsar historically also known as
                    Rāmdāspur and
                    colloquially as Ambarsar, is the second largest city in the Indian state of Punjab, after Ludhiana.

                    The city is the administrative headquarters of the Amritsar district.</p>
                <p> According to the United Nations, as of 2018, Amritsar is the second-most populous city in Punjab and
                    the most populous metropolitan region in the state with a population of roughly 2 million. Amritsar
                    is the centre of the Amritsar Metropolitan Region.</p>
                <p>According to the 2011 census, the population of Amritsar was 1,989,961. It is one of the ten
                    Municipal Corporations in the state, and Karamjit Singh Rintu is the current Mayor of the city.

                <p>Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh guru is credited with founding the holy city of Amritsar in the Sikh
                    tradition.Two versions of stories exist regarding the land where Guru Ram Das Ji settled.
                    In one based on a Gazetteer record, the land was purchased with Sikh donations, for 700 rupees from
                    the owners of the village of Tung</p>
                <p>According to the historical Sikh records, the site was chosen by Guru Amar Das and called Guru Da
                    Chakk, after he had asked Ram Das to find land to start a new town with a man-made pool as its
                    central point. After his coronation in 1574, and the hostile opposition he faced from the
                    sons of Guru Amar Das,Guru Ram Das ji founded the town named after him as "Ramdaspur". He
                    started by completing the pool, and building his new official Guru centre and home next to it. He
                    invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle into the new town with him. The
                    town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan Dev ji financed by donations and constructed by
                    voluntary work.</p>

                    <h1>Kashmir Valley</h1>
                </center>
                <p> The Kashmir Valley, also known as the Vale of Kashmir, is an intermontane valley in the
                    north-western part of the Indian Subcontinent.The valley is surrounded by ranges of the
                    Himalayas, bounded on the southwest by the Pir Panjal Range and on the northeast by the Greater
                    Himalayan range. It is approximately 135 km (84 mi) long and 32 km (20 mi) wide, and drained by the
                    Jhelum River.</p>
                <p>he Kashmir Valley lies between latitude 33° and 35°N, and longitude 73° and 76°E.The valley is
                    100 km (62 mi) wide and covers 15,520.3 km2 (5,992.4 sq mi) in area.[5] It is bounded by sub-ranges
                    of the Western Himalayas: the Great Himalayas bound it in the northeast and separate it from the
                    Tibetan plateau, whereas the Pir Panjal Range in the Lesser Himalayas bounds it on the west and
                    the south, and separates it from the Punjab Plain. The valley has an average elevation of 1,850
                    metres (6,070 ft) above sea-level, but the surrounding Pir Panjal range has an average elevation
                    of 10,000 feet (3,000 m).The Jhelum River is the main river of the Valley. It originates at
                    Verinag; its most important tributaries are the Lidder and Sind rivers. Unlike other areas of
                    Kashmir region, the Kashmir Valley is densely populated owing to the availability of a large expanse
                    of fertile flat land.</p>
                <p>The Kashmir Valley has a moderate climate, which is largely defined by its geographic location, with
                    the towering Karakoram Range in the north, Pir Panjal Range in the south and west, and Zanskar Range
                    in the east. It can be generally described as cool in the spring and autumn, mild in the summer
                    and cold in the winter. As a large valley with significant differences in geo-location among various
                    districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly areas compared to the flat lower parts.</p>
                <p>Summer is usually mild and fairly dry, but relative humidity is generally high and the nights are
                    cool. Precipitation occurs throughout the year and no month is particularly dry. The hottest month
                    is July (mean minimum temperature 16 °C, mean maximum temperature 32 °C) and the coldest are
                    December–January (mean minimum temperature −15 °C, mean maximum temperature 0 °C).</p>

                <p> Its capital is Bhopal, and the largest city is Indore, with Jabalpur, Ujjain, Gwalior, Sagar, Satna,
                    Narmadapuram, Shahdol, Rewa and Morena being the other major cities. Madhya Pradesh is the second
                    largest Indian state by area and the fifth largest state by population with over 72 million
                    residents. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the east,
                    Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest.</p>
                <p>The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient Avanti
                    Mahajanapada, whose capital Ujjain (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second
                    wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the
                    major dynasties of India. The Maratha Empire dominated the majority of the 18th century. After the
                    Anglo-Maratha Wars in the 19th century, the region was divided into several princely states under
                    the British and incorporated into Central Provinces and Berar and the Central India Agency. After
                    India's independence, Madhya Pradesh state was created with Nagpur as its capital: this state
                    included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's
                    Maharashtra. In 1956, this state was reorganised and its parts were combined with the states of
                    Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal to form the new Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking
                    Vidarbha region was removed and merged with the Bombay State. This state was the largest in India by
                    area until 2000, when its southeastern Chhattisgarh region was designated a separate state. </p>
                <p>Isolated remains of Homo erectus found in Hathnora in the Narmada Valley indicates that Madhya
                    Pradesh might have been inhabited in the Middle Pleistocene era.[16] Painted pottery dated to the
                    later mesolithic period has been found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters.[17] Chalcolithic sites
                    belonging to Kayatha culture (2100–1800 BCE) and Malwa culture (1700–1500 BCE) have been discovered
                    in the western part of the state.[18] Madhya Pradesh is also the world's ninth-most populous
                    subnational entity.</p>
                <p>The city of Ujjain arose as a major centre in the region, during the second wave of Indian
                    urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. It has served as the capital of the Avanti kingdom. Other
                    kingdoms mentioned in ancient epics – Malava, Karusha, Dasarna and Nishada – have also been
                    identified with parts of Madhya Pradesh.</p>

                <p>Chandragupta Maurya conquered northern India around 320 BCE, establishing the Mauryan Empire, which
                    included all of modern-day Madhya Pradesh. Ashoka the greatest of Mauryan rulers, conquered it,
                    bringing the region under firmer control. After the decline of the Maurya empire, the region was
                    contested among the Sakas, the Kushanas, the Satavahanas, and several local dynasties during the 1st
                    to 3rd centuries CE. Heliodorus, the Greek Ambassador to the court of the Shunga King Bhagabhadra
                    erected the Heliodorus pillar near Vidisha.</p>
                <p>Ujjain emerged as the predominant commercial centre of western India from the first century CE,
                    located on the trade routes between the Ganges plain and India's Arabian Sea ports. The Satavahana
                    dynasty of the northern Deccan and the Saka dynasty of the Western Satraps fought for the control of
                    Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.</p>
